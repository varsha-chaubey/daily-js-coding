Check if Two Strings are Isomorphic
✅ Problem Statement:
Two strings s and t are isomorphic if characters in s can be replaced to get t.

🔁 Every occurrence of a character must map to the same character in the other string, and no two characters from s can
map to the same character in t.

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true

Logic:
You need to ensure:

A character in s maps to only one character in t

A character in t is not mapped by more than one character in s

You can use two hash maps (or objects) to track the mappings from s → t and from t → s.



<script>
    function isIsomorphic(s, t) {
        if (s.length !== t.length) return false;

        let mapST = {};
        let mapTS = {};

        for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
            let charS = s[i];
            let charT = t[i];

            if (mapST[charS] && mapST[charS] !== charT) return false;
            if (mapTS[charT] && mapTS[charT] !== charS) return false;
            mapST[charS] = charT;
            mapTS[charT] = charS;
        }
        return true;

    }
    console.log(isIsomorphic("egg", "add"));    // true
    console.log(isIsomorphic("foo", "bar"));    // false
    console.log(isIsomorphic("paper", "title"));//true
